# marketing-online-retailer

This explores the marketing opportunities offered by the advertising program of an online retailer as well as the importance of its social media community.
The objective will be to better target marketing to increase revenues. 

Specifically, this report will explore two different types of marketing. 
First, the number of social media conversations by topics will be used to understand the importance of the word of mouth on social media to drive revenues.
Then, the influence over the revenues of the three advertising channels that the brand uses and the optimal distribution of the spending will be modeled.
